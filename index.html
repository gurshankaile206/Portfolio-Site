        <h2><span>About Me</span></h2>
        <p>
            I'm currently on a mission to get an entry level job as a 
            web developer or software engineer. I have previous experience in 
            sales but I decided to transition into a technical career. 
            I'm currently attending Epicodus, a bootcamp which will help 
            me learn the following tech stack so I can 
            become job ready and create real world projects. 
        </p>
        <ul> <span>Technologies I'm Learning:</span>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>BootStrap</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>C#/.NET</li>
            <li>React</li>
        </ul>

            <p>
                Listed below are the top 3 projects
                I have made during the first week of 
                Epicodus. We used HTML and CSS. Click on the names to
                access my projects on Github.
            </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                This is the first Webpage I've ever
                created.
            </p> 
            <a href="https://github.com/gurshankaile206/my-first-webpage">
                <li>My first Webpage</li>
            </a>
            <p>
                The second one is a "Hello world" Webpage where we say
                hello in different languages.
            </p>
            <a href="https://github.com/gurshankaile206/hello-world">
                <li>Hello-world</li>
            </a>
            <p>
                This third one is a page my team and I made for our 
                cupcake shop.
